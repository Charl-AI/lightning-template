</div>

Template for machine learning projects with [Pytorch Lightning](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), focussed on allowing research projects to get set up quickly. The template includes an MNIST example, logging with weights and biases, and a recommended style guide.

**This README serves as a style guide and gives some general advice for getting the most out of this template. To start a new project, create a new repo with the "Use this template" button. Upon doing do, the update-readme.yml action will run - deleting this README and replacing it with ```project-specific-README.md``` (it will also perform a find and replace to update all lines with "REPO-NAME" with the actual name of the repo)**
